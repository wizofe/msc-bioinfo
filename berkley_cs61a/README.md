# Composing Programs

In the tradition of SICP, this is a free online Python approach focused on abstraction, 
programming paradigms, and techniques for managing the complexity of large programs.

## Starting with Shakespeare

See the connected `SICP.py` Google Colab Notebook for more information about the coding.

### Main ideas

- <strong>Statements & Expressions</strong>:
Usually programs compute a value (of an expression) or carry out some action (with a statement).

- <strong>Functions</strong>:
Encapsulate the logic that manipulates data.

- <strong>Objects</strong>: 
A `set` is a type of object. It bundles together data and the logic that manipulates that data, 
in a way that manages the complexity of both.

- <strong>Interpreters</strong>:
